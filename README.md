For the EXAM, NEED to officially register  either via Campus / ALMA or written if the student cannot register online (closer to the exam date).  

**Grading** : Maximum between 70\% written exam+30\% assignments and 100\% exam.   

* Every assignment is composed by several exercises, which will be released sequentially. Information about assignment submission will be provided later in time but it will be made electronically. 

* Assignment may be done and submitted in groups of up to 3 people (optional).
